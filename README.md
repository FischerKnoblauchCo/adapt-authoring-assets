# adapt-authoring-assets


### Work in progress!

* This should be considered as prototype/ draft and working scaffold for this module.

### What should work

* Basic functionality
* Implementation of basic API (see: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19veTYxGN96B30pt80gaPam25hxoRkseaxnBpo5sAYLk/edit#)
* Upload of multiple files 


### To be discussed

* Structure / Architecture
* Abstraction level
* Naming (Classes, resources) : api/asset or api/assets (first is as in legacy version, second is more consistent)
* Dependencies
* Details


### Missing
* Comments
* Proper Error Handling
* Tests
* Querying for specific assets based on title, description, tags... (API not yet defined?)
* Authorization

### Missing B
* Collections (Categories) of Assets
* Replacement of an Asset File itself. (E.g. to automatically replace a specific asset throughout a course.)
